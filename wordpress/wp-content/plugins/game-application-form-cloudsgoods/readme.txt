Widget with a playable application form increases the conversion of form submissions by 15 times

== Description ==

Install a playable application form that increases the conversion of submitting the form by 15 times.

At the same time, some mechanics provide a referral program in the game, therefore, your game will quickly become viral, as visitors will share the referral link to the game in order to win in the players' standings!

This versatile marketing tool collects contacts and attracts new traffic not only on the website, but it can also be placed on social networks, in offline establishments and even in a mobile application.

**How it works?**
We automatically create a game for your brand (with your logo and products), in this game you set gifts that will drop out to players, such as discounts, promo codes, points or goods. Such drop-down prizes stimulate a person to make the first purchase on your site faster. In order to pick up this prize, the player must leave his contact.

Having a visitor's contact, the company can send marketing mailings via email, sms or various messengers that will encourage customers to make purchases.

Game mechanics also work well on repeat clients. For example, if you have your own offline establishment (shop, restaurant, etc.), then you can place a game using a QR code to collect visitor contacts and encourage them to make new purchases with gifts.

There are game mechanics with a referral program - this means that your players will share the game with friends and acquaintances in order to win in the standings.
